## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Electrical and Electronics Engineer transitioning into Data Science and Programming.

My expertise in instrumentation for data acquisition during drilling operations within the Oil and Gas industry provides a strong foundation for building robust, data-driven solutions. Excited to leverage my skills to analyze complex datasets, automate processes, and create impactful projects.

Here, I will be posting my code for every skill I will be learning through the different courses I will be taking.
